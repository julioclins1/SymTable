What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was nice. Felt like cos 226 again

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   symtablelist.c: line 96: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 184: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 281: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?


Since we have no information on the type of pvValue or pvExtra (they
are void*, after all), we cannot assert that they are not NULL. In
fact, they could be NULL. So we should know make such validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

Checking symtablehash.c

   symtablehash.c: line 228: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 359: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 471: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?


Same as before. pvValue or pvExtra are void*, so we don't know what
types they might be, or what values they might take. Thus we cannot
assert that they are NULL, since NULL is a valid option.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.010000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.010000 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 100.5000 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed More than 5 minutes.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.010000 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.390000 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 68.09000 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.020000 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.210000 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 2.060000 seconds.
